   - **Planner Vesrion:** change your lateral planner version. 1 = 0.8.13 2 = 0.8.16
   - **Controller Type:** Override the default controller. 1 = PID 2 = LQR 3 = Torque Your Vehicle may not support all the options, YMMV.

     - **When set speed Above:** when acc SET speed above the setting, it will switch to alternative controller. 1 km/h = 0.62 mph
     - **Alternative controller:** 1 = PID 2 = LQR 3 = Torque. Your Vehicle may not support all the options, YMMV

User Data

By default, dragopilot does upload data to comma servers(unless user turns off the toggle). You may enable data collection and forwarding to either comma or retropilot.api via toggle under DP general.
Logger is on by default.
We log crashes and fingerprinters to our sentry server.
Mapd when toggle and enabled will automatic upload your gps trace to openstreetmap for everyone to see. This to help the mappers who work on openstreetmaps better map your area.
